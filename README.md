*2025 Edition of the bi-annual inter-university Pictures to Numbers course on quantitative image analysis.*

The aim of this course is to lower the threshold for researchers who use microscopy on a routine basis and demand image analysis for their own research. Fundamental insights into image processing and analysis are complemented by practical, hands-on training sessions using open-source software. Participants with concrete case studies are given priority as the course is conceived to be interactive and application-oriented.
